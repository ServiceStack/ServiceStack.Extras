    <h3><a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack">Web Services Framework</a></h3>
    <p>
        ServiceStack is a config-free, code-first web and services framework
        embraced around Martin Fowler's remote-service best-practices in idiomatic C# - with implicit support for returning popular
        <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Service-return-types">.NET's response types</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Error-Handling">idiomatic handling of C# Exceptions</a>
        and <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Customize-HTTP-Responses">full-control over HTTP Responses</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's
        <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/What-is-a-message-based-web-service%3F">message-based design</a>
        provides the
        <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Advantages-of-message-based-web-services">most advantages</a>
        for remote services encapsulating them in their most re-usable form allowing the <b>same service</b> to be called
        in REST, SOAP, MQ services enabling
        <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/C%23-client">.NET's most succinct, end-to-end typed API</a>
        without the use of code-gen, additional machinery or post build steps.

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/OpenId">Open Id Auth Providers</a></h3>
    <p>
        Contained in the ServiceStack.Authentication.OpenId NuGet package is ServiceStack's support of OpenId 2.0
        Authentication. This allows ServiceStack-enabled ASP.NET / MVC sites and web services to authenticate and accept
        registration from any OpenId 2.0 Authentication provider.
    </p>
    <p>
        Like most .NET OpenId libraries the

<div class="caching">
    <h3><a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Caching">Caching API and Rich, Fast Providers</a></h3>
    <p>
        As caching is an essential technology in the development of high-performance web services, Service Stack has a number of
        different caching options available that each share the same
        <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack.Interfaces/CacheAccess/ICacheClient.cs">common client interface</a>
        for the following cache providers:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Redis, Memcached, InMemory, Azure, DynamoDb</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Any response can be cached with the in-built Caching Pattern available in the ToOptimizedResultUsingCache extension method.
        This caches the most optimal result for all formats (inc. user-defined), i.e. if your browser supports gzip/deflate
        it will cache the compressed output.

<div class="security mini">
    <h3><a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Security">Declarative Security Restrctions</a></h3>
    <p>
        ServiceStack includes the ability to limit the visibility and accessibility of services using built-in
        declarative Restrict attributes. Restrictions can be applied on the different attributes of a Service
        request including it's network proximity, endpoint type, format, encryption, call style, http method, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        Visibility controls whether its existence is publicized on externally viewed metadata pages and
        services, whilst accessibility restrictions controls which usage scenarios the service can be called.
    </p>
    <p>
        It supports multiple fine-grained restriction scenarios that can easily enforce popular configurations
        like hiding admin services or only allowing HTTP plain-text traffic from Internal Networks and only allow
        external access via secure HTTPS.
    <p>
</div>
<div class="authentication">
    <h3><a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Authentication-and-authorization">Authentication and authorization</a></h3>
    <p>
        Built into ServiceStack is an optional Authentication feature that can be used to add Authentication to
        existing services to Authenticate and Assign/UnAssign Roles to existing as well as registering new users.
    </p>
    <p>
        Highly substitutable and customizable and easy to plug-in custom Auth logic, and change
        back-end caching and session providers used to persist UserAuth data.
        By default transparently merges Auth and user data from:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Credentials, Basic Auth, Digest Auth, Custom Auth, Twitter OAuth, Facebook OAuth and OpenId</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        It integrates seamlessly with the rest of ServiceStack and allows UserAuth info to be stored in multiple repositories:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>OrmLite, Redis, InMemory, Mongo DB, Raven DB, NHibernate.
            <b>Session</b>: InMemory, Redis, Memcached, Azure, AWS DynamoDb</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div class="session mini">
    <h3><a href="">User Sessions</a></h3>
    <p>
        ServiceStack's Sessions is an efficient, clean API supporting both typed and dynamic access that works
        on top of any of ServiceStack's existing <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Caching">caching providers</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike ASP.NET's built-in sessions, it doesn't have
        <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3629709/i-just-discovered-why-all-asp-net-websites-are-slow-and-i-am-trying-to-work-out">any degrading performance locking issues</a>,
        instead access to sessions is optimistic and the typed Session API enables atomic access session information.
        The <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Authentication-and-authorization">Authentication feature</a>
        transparently leverages the Session support to provide instant access to an authenticated users session information.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since the Session support is built-on clean, legacy-free and code-first APIs, they are easily accessed
        from other ASP.NET frameworks where the same ServiceStack session can be shared between WebForms or MVC.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="messaging">
    <h3><a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Messaging-and-Redis">Messaging and MQ Brokers</a></h3>
    <p>
        Thanks to its
        <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/What-is-a-message-based-web-service%3F">message-based design</a>,
        ServiceStack Services are already well suited for processing by MQ Brokers.
        As MQ services promote low-coupling and provide the most durable and reliable link between two endpoints,
        it is more suitable for many offline, background and parallelizable tasks that have historically
        only been done with web services.
    </p>
    <p>
        ServiceStack greatly improves the dev experience as it lets you re-use existing Services saving all the
        dev effort required to implement, whilst letting you trivially debug them since they're available as a normal REST service.
    </p>
    <p>
        By default ServiceStack ships with a distributed
        <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/What-is-a-message-based-web-service%3F">Redis MQ</a>
        and an InMemory and RCON MQ Hosts.
        In future we intend to provide MQ Service adapters for RabbitMQ, Amazon SQS, Azure ServiceBus and ZeroMQ brokers.

    <p>
        .NET's leading C# client for the Redis NoSQL datastore.
        <a href="http://redis.io">Redis</a> is one of the fastest and most feature-rich key-value
        stores to come from the NoSQL movement.
        It is similar to memcached but the dataset is not volatile,
        and values can either be stored in comp-sci data structures including
        strings lists, sets, sorted sets or hashes.
    </p>
    <p>
        It includes in-built support for

    <p>
        In order to accessing physical files in view engines from multiple sources, ServiceStack includes its own pluggable
        virtual file system API that lets it support multiple filesystem backends.
    </p>
    <p>
        The virtual file system (VFS) is what allows ServiceStack to support view engines in a standard ASP.NET websites
        (e.g. serving directories from the root directory) as well in self-hosting stand-alone HttpListener websites and
        Windows Services serving from the output /bin directory as well as embedded resources inside .dlls, any combination
        of both and in future from remote datastores.

    <p>
        In addition to the built-in auto-generated metadata pages, ServiceStack also includes support for Swagger a
        popular metadata service description and UI to describe and introspect REST services. The SwaggerFeature is
        available in the ServiceStack.Api.Swagger NuGet package that's easy value-add to any existing ServiceStack instance.
    </p>
    <p>
        Swagger builds on the existing Route and DataMember metadata DTO attributes shared by ServiceStack's built-in
        <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Metadata-page">automated metadata pages</a> and adds
        Custom Api and ApiMember attributes you can use to further annotate your services for Swagger.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="metadata">
    <h3><a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Metadata-page">Metadata</a></h3>
    <p>
        Thanks to ServiceStack's strongly typed, convention-based, message-based design it's able to infer a greater
        intelligence of your services which allows it to provide automated
        <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Metadata-page">generated metadata pages</a>
        available from the /metadata route.
    </p>

        <a href="http://miniprofiler.com">Mini Profiler</a>
        was ported and built right into ServiceStack. Once enabled, the auto HTML pages of each service will include
        the Mini Profiler info widget which when expanded provides a detailed summary view highlighting where all
        the time processing the request was spent.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to viewing the overall time spent on different parts of ServiceStack's request pipeline, you

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/The-IoC-container">Inversion of Control</a></h3>
    <p>
        ServiceStack was designed from the ground up to promote best practice remote service and code development
        best-practices. With these goals we embed a port of the extremely fast and minimal Funq IOC which
        contains 90% of the most used features behind an intuitive API at a fraction of the code-size of most Heavy-weight IOC's
        which perform orders of magnitude slower. We've enhanced Funq to add support for Auto-wiring and Request lifetime scope.
    </p>
    <p>
        Alternatively you can opt to use your preferred IOC instead which is supported via the IContainerAdapter interface.
        The <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/The-IoC-container#use-ninject">IOC wiki</a>
        includes instructions on enabling Ninject, StructureMap, Windsor and AutoFac IOC's.

<div class="configuration">
    <h3><a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Config-API">Rich, Typed Human-Friendly Config</a></h3>
    <p>
        Configuration is another area in .NET suffering from over-complication, over-use, tight-coupling and un-necessary friction.
        Only configurable parts of your app should be exposed in the Web.config, as it is a less capable, less verifiable and more
        brittle option than configuring deps in code.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is another point of friction we solve with our impl-agnostic Config API which leverages the human-friendly
        <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Text/wiki/JSV-Format">JSV Format</a> to in maintaining typed values,
        .NET collections and rich complex object graphs (hydrated into POCOs), inside a single human-friendly appSetting.
    </p>
    <p>
        The dep-free API decouples the configuration of your dependencies from the Web.config and allows the ideal scenario of
        being able to specify default values in code, whilst remaining overridable with any Config source, e.g. Web.Config or Generic Dictionary, etc.

<div class="dump-utils">
    <h3><a href="http://www.servicestack.net/mythz_blog/?p=202">Productive Dump and Diagnostic utils</a></h3>
    <p>
        Often when developing or diagnosing software you will find the need to log and introspect .NET objects during debugging,
        whilst creating tests, or with runtime logging.
    </p>
    <p>
        Rather than manually inspecting watch lists, or manually writing out
        print statements for individual properties, ServiceStack provides the handy Dump() extension method to return a recursively
        pretty printed dump of an object graph as well as Print() and PrintDump() methods to print formatted strings and objects
        directly to the console.
    </p>
    <p>
        These diagnostic utils are all available as extension methods allowing for fluid chained-expressions on any object or string.

<div class="auto-mapping">
    <h3><a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Auto-mapping">Built-in Auto Mapping</a></h3>
    <p>
        Although we encourage the remote service best practices of
        <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/15369736/85785">keeping separate DTO models</a>,
        you wont need to maintain your own manual mapping yourself as you can leverage ServiceStack's built-in Auto Mapping support.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Auto-mapping support is resilient and comprehensive and does a great job of fuzzy mapping in being able
        to co-erce values of one type into another, e.g. you can convert between different Enum types with the same name, between
        Enums and any value type and Strings, between properties and fields, POCOs and strings, vice-versa and many things in between.

    <p>
        Being developed on top of raw ASP.NET Http Handlers has many benefits, one of them is
        that we're built on top of the ASP.NET HTTP abstractions so we're able to easily
        integrate with other ASP.NET frameworks like WebForms and ASP.NET MVC.

<div class="protocol-buffers">
    <h3><a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Protobuf-format">Google's Fast Protocol Buffer Format</a></h3>
    <p>
        Protocol Buffers is a high-performance, compact binary wire format invented by Google who use it internally
        for almost all of its internal RPC protocols and file formats.
    </p>
    <p>
        ProtoBuf is a great addition to your ServiceStack services which includes .NET's 2 fastest Binary and Text-based formats.
        For the .NET implementation we leverage
        <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/23354/marc-gravell">@marcgravell</a>
        excellent <a href="https://code.google.com/p/protobuf-net/">protobuf-net</a>
        - which is currently .NET's fastest serializer.
        It's also the most compact which makes it an ideal choice in performance
        sensitive areas, e.g. transferring binary data or a large dataset as efficiently as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        ServiceStack's support of ProtoBuf is packaged in the <b>ProtoBufFormat</b> plugin available in the
        <a href="https://nuget.org/packages/ServiceStack.Plugins.ProtoBuf">ProtoBuf NuGet package</a> which includes
        both the Server Format as well as a

    <p>
        <a href="http://msgpack.org">Message Pack</a> is another fast binary serializer that thanks to its simplicity and
        speed is a popular choice amongst Open Source libraries and frameworks that has bindings for most popular languages.
    </p>
    <p>
        Its schema-less format modelled after JSON that instead uses a compact binary encoding.
        Despite its name it's a
        <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6355497/performant-entity-serialization-bson-vs-messagepack-vs-json">better Binary JSON than BSON</a>
        as it's faster, smaller and doesn't include foreign artefacts BSON has.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because of its schema-less design it's able to work with un-attributed POCOs, unlike ProtoBuf which
        requires each DTO property to be attributed with a numerical index.
    </p>
    <p>
        ServiceStack's support of MsgPack is packaged in the <b>MsgPackFormat</b> plugin available in the

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Http-Utils">Succinct HTTP Client Utils</a></h3>
    <p>
        The optimal way to call ServiceStack services is to use any of the typed generic
        <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/C%23-client">C# Service Clients</a>.
        Consuming 3rd Party REST APIs historically hasn't been a great experience as it relies
        on the legacy <b>WebRequest</b> which is versatile but also suffers from exposing an out-dated and
        unpleasant API for your app code to use.
    </p>
    <p>
        Rather than the normal .NET approach of wrapping Web Request inside a suite of proxy classes,
        we instead encapsulate redundant boilerplate behind extension methods with opt-in features
        behind named params, DRYing common patterns behind terse, chained APIs.
    </p>
    <p>
        This leaves a pleasant and intuitive API that allows most HTTP clients tasks in a single readable chained expression.
        It remains versatile as it allows overriding default behavior and access to the raw HTTP Request and Responses
        using filters and named params.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="typed-clients">
    <h3><a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/C%23-client">Generic Typed C#/.NET Service Clients</a></h3>
    <p>
        In order to provide the most productive and frictionless end-to-end development experience you need a great client
        story, and ServiceStack's generic and typed .NET service clients are best-in-class.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a side-effect of the
        <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Advantages-of-message-based-web-services">inherent benefits in our message-based design</a>,
        we can provide .NET's most succinct, end-to-end typed API <b>without any code-gen or post-build steps</b>.
        You're able to re-use the code-first DTO's services were defined with, as-is, inside clients.
    </p>
    <p>
        This has many benefits, client/server DTO's are kept in sync, you're not reliant on black-box tooling,
        <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/12413091/85785">message-based DTO designs are more resilient</a>, and support
        the natural evolution of services. It's inherently simpler with less friction as client and server call-sites
        have symmetrical parity as the same DTO the client sends is transparently hydrated into services on the server.
