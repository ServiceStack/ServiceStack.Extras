<div id="content">

	<span class="summary">
		As an Open Source project our primary goals are to broaden the reach of our software, grow our community and expand our knowledge-base. 
		To measure the state of ServiceStack's ecosystem we've collected some stats to track our progress towards these goals.
	</span>

	<h2>ServiceStack's End of Days, end of 2012 Community Report</h2>

	<p>
		At the start of 2012 we were still a fairly unknown option in .NET and were only 6 months into offering official releases on NuGet which were off to a relatively slow start. We started to see our first real momentum after publishing some <a href="http://www.servicestack.net/benchmarks/">benchmarks</a> helping solidify our reputation as a performance-focused framework and from our first real exposure to a wide .NET audience with our <a href="#">January interview on hanselminutes</a> kickstarting an exciting year for ServiceStack...
	</p>

	<p>
		Throughout the year we've made constant and significant technological progress in implementation and features with the release of our <a href="#">New API</a> that was <a href="#">well-received on Hacker News</a> closely followed by our <a href="#">Razor and HTML ViewEngine support</a> upgrading ServiceStack to a full-featured web framework capable of having the same service serving REST, Web, Mobile, SOAP and MQ clients. To improve message throughput at <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow Careers</a> we enhanced ServiceStack's MQ Support with a new <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Messaging-and-redis">multi-threaded Redis Mq Host</a> allowing different services to be parallelized and processed in the background. We also cut Careers build time in 1/2 by adopting <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/Bundler">ServiceStack's node.js-based Bundler</a> for all our js, css and less compilation and minification needs.
	</p>

	<h4>Mid year update</h4>
	<p>
		Our technical progress ensured by mid-2012 we had gained a lot of momentum by the time we published our <a href="http://www.servicestack.net/100k-downloads/">first status report</a>. We've continued to grow rapidly since then and have collected many of the end-of-year statistics below to track how well we did in 2012.
	</p>

	<h4>Public coverage</h4>
	<p>
		2012 was also the debut of ServiceStack's first official presentation at a tech conference with <a href="https://twitter.com/demisbellot">@demisbellot's</a> first <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/newmovie/what-istheservicestack-14819151">What is the ServiceStack</a> intro talk at <a href="http://monkeyspace.org">monkeyspace.org</a> in October. The year continued to host a number of other talks performed around the globe by other ServiceStack Community members: <a href="https://twitter.com/cyberzeddk">Stefan Poulsen</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/kylehodgson">Kyle Hodgson</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/RobGibbens">Rob Gibbens</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/wildturtle21">Sam Abraham</a> and others.
		Whilst <a href="https://twitter.com/jsonmez">John Sonmez</a> creator of <a href="http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/service-stack">ServiceStack's PluralSight course</a> has done a string of Interviews on the <a href="http://thetabletshow.com/?ShowNum=60">The Tablet Show</a> and has ended the year as we started by appearing on <a href="https://twitter.com/shanselman">Scott Hanselman's</a> popular <a href="www.hanselminutes.com/348/more-on-service-stack-with-john-sonmez">hanselminutes</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		With the current momentum behind ServiceStack we've started to see interest from high-profile IT sites like InfoQ who last week published an <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/interview-servicestack">in-depth interview with the ServiceStack's project lead</a> explaining its differences in technology and philosophy from WCF. Part 2 of the Interview will be published next week on <a href="http://www.infoq.com">InfoQ</a> explaining what a message-based service is, the motivation behind ServiceStack's HTML Story, the state of .NET Open Source and some of the exciting things we have planned for next year.
	</p>

	<a name="contributors"></a>
	<h3>Contributors</h3>
	<p>
		One of the statistics we're especially proud of is the number of new Open Source contributors we've been able to attract throughout the year, we're even happier that many were first-time contributors to Open Source, doing our best to encourage more .NET developers to participate in OSS.
		Having lots of contributors are important for ensuring a high quality and value-focused code-base as they provide a tight feedback loop ensuring we only add real-world useful features capable of supporting multiple use-cases that are hardened and tested against different environments.
	</p>
	<p>
		We started the year with <b>35 contributors</b> by mid-year we hit <b>88 contributors</b> and we're now ending the year with an impressive <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Contributors">140 Contributors!</a>. As it's rare for a .NET project, the news that we broke <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2012/10/service-stack-100-contributors">100+ Contributors made it on InfoQ</a>.

<h3>Questions on StackOverflow</h3>
<p>
	Other than our <a href="http://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki">comprehensive wiki documentation</a>, another great place to maintain a growing knowledge-base is on StackOverflow since you can get direct answers to real world problems. We're happy to see this number more than double from <b>356</b> questions grow to <b>740</b> questions in the last 6 months.
